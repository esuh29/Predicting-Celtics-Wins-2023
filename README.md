# Predicting-Celtics-Wins-2023
Our team, consisting of myself,  Phillip Kim, Mary Ann Nguyen, and Tessa Wu, completed a machine learning project using a dataset we compiled from FiveThirtyEight and BasketballReference.

Within the provided folders, you will find Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning model creation. We have also included the final CSV file and the script used to process the dataset for our project.

Additionally, attached is a .pdf of our presentation, which highlights the challenges we encountered, our model's performance, and key insights from the project.
