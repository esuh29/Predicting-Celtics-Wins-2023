# Predicting-Celtics-Wins-2023


Our team—Phillip Kim, Mary Ann Nguyen, Tessa Wu, and myself—completed a machine learning project predicting the Celtics' 2022-2023 regular season wins. We used datasets from the 2018-2019 to the 2021-2022 seasons, compiled from FiveThirtyEight and BasketballReference.

In the provided folders, you'll find Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning model creation. We have also included the final CSV file and the script used to process the dataset for this project. Additionally, a PDF of our presentation is attached, detailing the challenges we encountered, the performance of our model, and key insights from the project.
